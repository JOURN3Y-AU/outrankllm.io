## Local Search is Going AI

Local search queries are increasingly directed at AI assistants:

- "Who's the best plumber in Denver?"
- "Recommend a family restaurant near downtown Austin"
- "Find me a reliable electrician in Brooklyn"
- "What's a good hair salon for curly hair in Seattle?"

Unlike traditional local SEO where you optimize for Google's local pack, local GEO requires understanding how AI assistants find and recommend local businesses. The rules are different, and most local businesses haven't adapted.

## How AI Handles Local Queries

AI assistants approach local queries differently than search engines:

### Location Understanding
AI must first understand *where* the user is asking about. It recognizes:
- Explicit locations ("in Denver")
- Neighborhoods and districts
- Relative locations ("near me" with user location)
- Regional terminology

### Business Discovery
AI draws local business information from:
- Google Business Profile data
- Yelp and TripAdvisor listings
- Industry-specific directories
- Local news and blogs
- Social media mentions
- Review sites

### Recommendation Criteria
When recommending local businesses, AI weighs:
- Review volume and sentiment
- Relevance to the specific query
- Recency of reviews
- Specificity of match to request
- Business details (hours, services, specialties)

## The Local GEO Framework

### 1. Business Information Consistency

AI needs to correctly identify and locate your business. Inconsistent information causes confusion.

**NAP Consistency:**
- Name, Address, Phone must match exactly across all platforms
- Use the exact same business name everywhere
- Include suite/unit numbers consistently
- Use consistent phone number format

**Business Categories:**
- Choose accurate primary and secondary categories
- Match categories across all platforms
- Don't over-categorize (dilutes relevance)

**Service Area Definition:**
- Clearly define geographic service area
- Include neighborhoods and nearby areas you serve
- Be specific about service boundaries

### 2. Review Optimization

Reviews are the single biggest factor in local AI recommendations.

**Volume Strategy:**
- Aim for review velocity, not just total count
- Fresh reviews signal an active business
- Request reviews after every positive interaction

**Platform Diversification:**
- Google Business Profile (primary)
- Yelp (highly weighted in AI training)
- Industry-specific platforms (Houzz, Healthgrades, Avvo, etc.)
- Facebook recommendations
- NextDoor endorsements

**Review Quality:**
- Encourage specific, detailed reviews
- Ask customers to mention specific services
- Request feedback on particular aspects
- Reviews mentioning neighborhoods help local relevance

**Review Response:**
- Respond to all reviews promptly
- Thank positive reviewers
- Address negative reviews professionally
- Use responses to add relevant keywords naturally

### 3. Local Content Creation

Create content that establishes local relevance and expertise.

**Location-Specific Pages:**
- Pages for each neighborhood you serve
- Local landing pages with area-specific content
- "Serving [Area]" pages with relevant information

**Local Blog Content:**
- Posts about local events and community involvement
- Area-specific guides related to your service
- Local news and developments in your industry
- Seasonal content relevant to your location

**Local Case Studies:**
- Project showcases with location mentioned
- Before/after content with neighborhood context
- Customer success stories with local details

### 4. Query-Specific Optimization

Understand how locals search for your type of business.

**Service + Location Queries:**
- "[Service] in [City]"
- "[Service] near [Neighborhood]"
- "Best [service] in [Area]"

**Problem + Location Queries:**
- "[Problem] help in [City]"
- "Emergency [service] [Area]"
- "[Issue] repair near me"

**Attribute + Service + Location Queries:**
- "Affordable [service] in [City]"
- "24-hour [service] [Area]"
- "[Specialty] [service] near [Location]"

**Create content addressing each pattern:**
- Service pages optimized for location variations
- FAQ content answering common local queries
- Problem/solution content with local context

### 5. Local Authority Building

Establish your business as a trusted local entity.

**Local Media:**
- Local news coverage
- Community newspaper features
- Local podcast appearances
- Regional magazine mentions

**Community Involvement:**
- Sponsor local events
- Participate in community organizations

- Host or speak at local events

**Local Business Associations:**

### 6. Directory and Listing Optimization

AI aggregates information from business directories.

- Bing Places for Business

**Industry Directories:**
- HomeAdvisor, Angi (home services)

## Measuring Local GEO Success

### Test Queries to Monitor

Regularly test AI assistants with variations of:

1. "Best [your service] in [your city]"
2. "[Your service] near [your neighborhood]"
3. "Recommend a [your category] in [your area]"
4. "[Specific service you offer] in [location]"
5. "Good [your category] for [specific need] in [city]"

### What to Track

| Metric | What to Monitor |
|--------|-----------------|
| Mention presence | Are you mentioned at all? |
| Position | First recommendation, alternative, or late mention? |
| Accuracy | Correct address, hours, services? |
| Sentiment | How are you described? |
| Competitor position | Where do you rank vs local competitors? |

### Response Patterns

Note how AI responds to different query formulations:
- Does specifying your neighborhood help?
- Do specialty queries surface you?
- How do you appear in "best" vs "affordable" queries?

## Common Local GEO Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Ignoring Yelp
Many local businesses neglect Yelp because it's not their primary lead source. But Yelp content is heavily represented in AI training data.

### Mistake 2: Review Response Neglect
Unanswered reviews, especially negative ones, hurt both sentiment and engagement signals.

### Mistake 3: Inconsistent Business Information
Different addresses, phone numbers, or business names across platforms confuse AI about your identity.

### Mistake 4: Generic Content
Content that doesn't mention your location or local context doesn't build local relevance.

### Mistake 5: Single-Platform Focus
Optimizing only Google Business Profile misses the diversity of sources AI uses.
